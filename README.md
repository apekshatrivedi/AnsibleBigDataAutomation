# AnsibleBigDataAutomation

This repository contains scripts for automated big data cluster/Data Science cluster deployments using Ansible.

## What is Ansible?

It is an automation language that can be used to automate IT Infrastructure deployments. Ansible models IT infrastructure by describing how all of the systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time.

It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allows users to describe automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.

Ansible Tower is a framework for controlling,securing and managing ansible automation with a UI and RESTful API
